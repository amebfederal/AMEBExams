            <p>The AUI themes are powered by the latest versions of Bootstrap (v3.2.0), jQuery and all other widgets &amp; plugins included.</p>
            <p>We make weekly checks to see if any of the components included have been updated by their developers. It's very important to us to keep things up to date with the latest versions. Also, we hope to developer an automatic update feature that will be available in your user account.</p>

            <p>We know how important it is to keep things simple and to have them well documented. To make sure things go as smoothly as possible, when we added a new feature to the AUI framework core we immediately created the documentation for it.</p>
            <p>The AUI documentation includes code example snippets for all components included and also tutorials and guide to get you working on your AUI based project as soon as possible and without headaches.</p>
